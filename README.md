# MessageBoard

A simple, multi-threaded, event-driven chat client and server program to illustrate the principles of connected applications and modular programming.

Users can connect to the server, post messages, clear the server's message log, and disconnect. The server itself keeps a logfile which contains a record of all requests made by connected clients.

## Prerequesites

The programs are written in Java, using JDK 1.8 and JavaFX for the client's front-end.
