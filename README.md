# MessageBoard

A simple, multi-threaded chat client and server program to illustrate the principles of event-driven, connected applications and modular programming.

Users can connect to the server, post messages, clear the server's message log, and disconnect. The server itself keeps a logfile which contains a record of all requests made by connected clients.

## Technical Details

The programs are written in Java, using JDK 1.8 and JavaFX for the client's front-end. They use a TCP connection to communicate.
